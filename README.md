Notes to the reader: 
- This repo has a solution for detecting whether images are for the same product in https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching 
- The notebook has the steps to do training and inference on the prepared dataset from original dataset
- Preprocessing steps need to be added. Pls refer steps in https://www.kaggle.com/mkurian/shopee-submission. This notebook is a bit more cleaned up and misses the preprocessing, but essentially the Kaggle notebook and the jupyter notebook in this repo has the same solution.
- This was done as part of first Kaggle BIPOC Grant program. Here is the presentation that explains the approach and solution: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q0hC73Xvy1-_oo4Jdu9VKnO36ZpXQzNatfz9xDo3o64/edit#slide=id.p1
